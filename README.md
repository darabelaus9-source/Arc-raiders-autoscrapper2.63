Arc Raiders Inventory Auto Scrapper
Automates Arc Raiders inventory actions (Sell/Recycle) using screen capture and Tesseract (OCR).

This program does not hook into the game process, but there is no guarantee it will not be flagged by anti-cheat systems or violate the game’s Terms of Service. Use at your own risk.

Setup
This repo uses uv to manage Python + dependencies.

Clone the repo
From a terminal:

git clone https://github.com/zappybiby/ArcRaiders-AutoScrapper.git
cd ArcRaiders-AutoScrapper
Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
From the repo root, run the setup script

powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\setup-windows.ps1

Use a different supported Python version:
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\setup-windows.ps1 -PythonVersion 3.12
Linux
From the repo root, run the setup script

bash scripts/setup-linux.sh

Use a different supported Python version:
AUTOSCRAPPER_PYTHON_VERSION=3.12 bash scripts/setup-linux.sh
Usage
Open the Textual UI (default):

uv run autoscrapper
Start a scan directly:

uv run autoscrapper scan
uv run autoscrapper scan --dry-run
scan only supports the optional --dry-run flag. Other workflows are in the Textual UI.

How AutoScrapper Works:

Open your inventory and make sure you are scrolled to the top of it
Start the scan, then alt-tab back into the game. It will then begin after a few seconds.
Press the configured stop key (default Esc) to abort (may need multiple presses).
Linux notes:

Default target window title is Arc Raiders. Override with AUTOSCRAPPER_TARGET_APP if needed.
Automated Data Updates
This repo includes a scheduled GitHub Action that refreshes game data and default rules daily.

Workflow: .github/workflows/daily-data-update.yml
Schedule: daily at 14:00 UTC
Output: updates snapshot data + items_rules.default.json, then opens/updates a PR on branch bot/daily-data-update
Report: attaches artifacts/update-report.json and uses artifacts/update-report.md as PR body
The default rules are regenerated with this baseline:

all quests completed
workshop profile at level 2 for scrappy, weapon_bench, equipment_bench, med_station, explosives_bench, utility_bench, and refiner
Run updater locally
Real update (writes tracked files):
uv run python scripts/update_snapshot_and_defaults.py
Dry run (no tracked file writes):
uv run python scripts/update_snapshot_and_defaults.py --dry-run
